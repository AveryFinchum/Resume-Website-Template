# Resume Template based in HTML

This is my resume, coded in HTML, based on the **Maria Rojos** professional graphic designer resume template, found on novoresume.com.


## Inspiration

See the resume that inspired me from **novoresume** here: https://novoresume.com/career-blog/graphic-designer-resume  


## Printing to pdf

The way I turn the HTML into a pdf is using Chrome's built in print to pdf feature, though you should be able to use other browsers with a free pdf converter software. 

It is neccesary to print the page with zero inch margins so the colors extend to fill up the page, and I printed mine out at a custom scale of 80% so all my content fit on one page.
